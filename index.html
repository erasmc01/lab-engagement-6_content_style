        <h2>What about planet TOI-715 b? Why is it the new 'super-Earth'?</h2>
        <p>The new 'super-Earth' or <a
                href="https://science.nasa.gov/universe/exoplanets/discovery-alert-a-super-earth-in-the-habitable-zone/">TOI-715
                b</a> is comparable to that of our own Earth for countless reasons hence receiving its same. Below is
            listed
            the features that make it the new 'super-Earth'.</p>

                    <p><span class="bold">Planet TOI-715 b nicknamed the new 'super-Earth' is closely identical to our
                            own Earth as it is
                            potentially
                            habitable.</span> Planet TOI-715 b is positioned in the 'conservative' habitable zone of its
                        parent
                        star; a

                        which temperatures allow liquid water to exist on its surface.</p>

                        Because of its layout it
                        received its
                        name as
                        'super-Earth' indicating a larger size. Despite its size, this newly discovered planet only
                        takes
                        19 days
                        to
                        orbit its parent star while it takes a considerable 365 days for Earth to orbit the Sun.</p>

                        dwarf. This star goes by the name of TOI-715 and is smaller and cooler than our Sun. Because of
                        it being
                        a red dwarf star, planets like TOI-715 b can crowd closer and still be without risk within the

                        star's habitable zone.</p>

            <h2>Is Exterrestrial Life A Possibility?</h2>
            <p>Because of TOI-715 b being located in the habitable zone of its parent star (TOI-715), the question for
                exterrestial life outside of Earth debated. With more technological tools and facilities that guide
                astronomers into discovering planets within habitable zones, the search for exterrersital life in
                habitable
                zones remains a topic to be discussed.</p>

            <p>This 'super-Earth' was discovered by Tess, NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite. The
                international
                team of scientists who made the discovery was led by Georgina Dransfield from the University of
                Birmingham, United Kingdom.</p>
            <p>The tools/facilities used that made the discovery possible:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Gemini-South</li>
                <li>Las Cumbres Observatory telescopes</li>
